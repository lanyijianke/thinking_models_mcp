## Use Cases

### Solving Complex Problems

When facing complex problems, the system can recommend multiple thinking models to help you analyze problems from different angles and avoid mental blind spots.

### Improving Thinking Quality

Through structured thinking processes, avoid common cognitive biases and make more rational decisions.

### Learning Thinking Models

The system not only provides definitions of thinking models but also includes detailed teaching content, application examples, and notes to help you master various thinking tools.

### Creating Custom Models

When existing models cannot meet needs, you can create new thinking models or combine existing models to create innovative thinking frameworks.

## Quick Start

### Installation (Local Development)

If you want to run and develop this project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thinking-models-mcp.git # Replace with your repository address
cd thinking_models_mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### Starting the Server (Local Development)

1.  **Normal Start (stdio mode)**
    In the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    node build/thinking_models_server.js
    ```
    Or use the npm script (if configured in package.json):
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## Configuration Guide

You can integrate the thinking models MCP server into any client that supports the MCP protocol. Here are two different implementation methods:

### Method 1: Running the "Tianji" Server with Local Node.js

This method requires you to install and configure the "Tianji" server code locally and is suitable for scenarios where you need to customize development or modify server code.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tianji": { // "Tianji" server name
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "e:\\thinking_models_mcp\\build\\thinking_models_server.js" // Replace with your actual path
      ]
    }
  }
  // ... other configurations ...
}
```

### Method 2: Using NPX to Start the Server from a Remote npm Package

This method is simpler, doesn't require local installation of the full code, and directly pulls and runs packages from the npm repository.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thinking-models": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "--no-cache", // Avoid using cached versions, ensure using the latest version
        "@thinking-models/mcp-server" // npm package name
        // If you need to specify version: "@thinking-models/mcp-server@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
  // ... other configurations ...
}
```

**Command Line Arguments Explanation:**

- **`node`**: Directly use local Node.js to run JavaScript files
- **`npx`**: npm package runner, allows executing commands in npm packages without global or local installation
- **`--no-cache`**: Disable cache, ensure getting the latest version of the package each time, avoiding outdated versions

> **Important Note**: Server data will be automatically saved in the `data` folder of the installation directory. Even if the service restarts, previous data will be retained without additional configuration. It is recommended to use the `--no-cache` parameter to ensure getting the latest version each time, avoiding using outdated features due to cache issues.

### Basic Usage

After the "Tianji" server starts, you can send requests to access thinking model tools through the MCP client. For example:

```json
1. What is the current version number of "Tianji"?
2. How many thinking models does "Tianji" currently have available for me to use?
3. I want to check what types of thinking models are in "Tianji", tell me how many categories there are in total?
4. I encountered XXXX event, but I don't know what to do, please have "Tianji" recommend some thinking models that can help me solve the problem.
```

If configured correctly, the client should be able to call the server and return results.

# Watch mode, automatically recompile TypeScript files when changed
npm run watch

# In another terminal, start the development server (usually runs compiled files from the build directory)
# You might need a tool like nodemon to automatically restart the server
npm run start:dev # (assuming you've configured this script in package.json)
```

#### Core Modules

1.  **Server Core (thinking_models_server.ts)**
    *   Initializes the MCP server instance (`McpServer` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)
    *   Registers all available tools, defines their parameter schemas (using `zod`) and handler functions
    *   Loads and manages thinking model data
    *   Processes client requests and routes them to the appropriate tools

2.  **Thinking Model Types (`types.ts`)**
    *   Defines the core `ThinkingModel` interface, describing the model's data structure
    *   Other model-related TypeScript types and interfaces

3.  **Similarity Calculation Engine (`similarity_engine.ts`)**
    *   `calculateQueryMatch`: Calculates the match between user queries and thinking models
    *   `calculateKeywordRelevance`: Calculates the relevance of keyword lists to thinking models

4.  **Reasoning Process Management (`reasoning_process.ts`)**
    *   Used for building, managing, and visualizing structured reasoning paths

5.  **Learning System (`learning_capability.ts`)**
    *   `recordUserFeedback`: Records user feedback on model usage
    *   `detectKnowledgeGap`: Detects knowledge gaps based on user queries and feedback
    *   `adjustModelRecommendations`: Adjusts model recommendations based on learning data

### API Documentation

#### Server API

Server communication modes:

1.  **stdio API**
    *   Communicates with clients through standard input/output.
    *   Follows MCP protocol specifications.
    *   Usually managed automatically by clients (such as Cursor, Claude Desktop).

#### Tool API

Each tool is registered using the `server.tool()` method, containing:
1.  **Tool Name** (string): The name used by clients when calling.
2.  **Tool Description** (string): A brief description of the tool's functionality.
3.  **Parameter Schema** (Zod object): Uses the `zod` library to define the parameters accepted by the tool and their types, descriptions, and constraints.
4.  **Handler Function** (async function): Receives validated parameter objects, executes tool logic, and returns responses that comply with the MCP protocol.

##### Tool Registration Example

```typescript
// filepath: src/thinking_models_server.ts
// ... imports ...

server.tool(
  "get-model-count-by-category", // Tool name
  "Get the number of thinking models in a specified category", // Tool description
  { // Parameter schema (Zod schema)
    category: z.string().describe("Main category of thinking models to query"),
    lang: z.enum(["zh", "en"] as const).default("zh").describe("Language code ('zh' or 'en')")
  },
  async ({ category, lang }) => { // Handler function
    try {
      const modelsInBuffer = MODELS[lang] || []; // MODELS is a cache of loaded models
      const count = modelsInBuffer.filter(m => m.category === category).length;
      log(`Tool 'get-model-count-by-category' called: category=${category}, lang=${lang}, count=${count}`);
      return {
        content: [{
          type: "text",
          text: JSON.stringify({ category, lang, count }, null, 2)
        }]
      };
    } catch (error: any) {
      log(`Tool 'get-model-count-by-category' execution error: ${error.message}`);
      return {
        content: [{
          type: "text",
          text: JSON.stringify({ error: "Failed to get model count", message: error.message }, null, 2)
        }]
      };
    }
  }
);
```

### Extension Guidelines

#### Adding New Tools

1.  In thinking_models_server.ts (or related module files), register your new tool using the `server.tool()` method, as shown in the example above.
2.  Define clear parameter schemas and descriptions.
3.  Implement the tool's handler function, ensuring it includes error handling and logging.
4.  Recompile the project (`npm run build`).

#### Creating New Thinking Models

1.  Create a new `.json` file in the zh (Chinese) or en (English) directory.
2.  The filename is typically the model's ID (for example, `new_decision_matrix.json`).
3.  The file content should conform to the structure of the `ThinkingModel` interface (defined in types.ts). Example:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "new_decision_matrix",
      "name": "New Decision Matrix Model",
      "definition": "A structured method for evaluating options under multiple criteria.",
      "purpose": "Help make rational choices among complex options.",
      "category": "Decision Making",
      "subcategories": ["Multi-criteria Decision"],
      "tags": ["decision", "matrix", "evaluation", "selection"],
      "use_cases": ["Product feature prioritization", "Vendor selection"],
      // ... other fields like popular_science_teaching, limitations, common_pitfalls, visualizations, etc.
    }
    ```
4.  The server will automatically load the new model when it starts, or if file monitoring is enabled, it will also reload when the file is saved.

#### Modifying Recommendation Algorithms

Recommendation logic is mainly located in similarity_engine.ts and recommendations.ts.
-   **`similarity_engine.ts`**: Contains core algorithms for calculating text similarity and keyword relevance. You can adjust these algorithms' weights, techniques used (such as TF-IDF, embedding vectors, etc.) to improve matching precision.
-   **`recommendations.ts`**: Contains functions like `getModelRecommendations` that use the similarity engine's results to generate the final model recommendation list. You can modify the logic here, such as how to combine scores from different sources or how to adjust recommendations based on context.

### Testing

The project typically uses testing frameworks like Jest.

#### Writing Tests

Create test files for your modules or functions in the `tests` directory (for example, `tests/my_tool.test.ts`).

```typescript
// tests/example_tool.test.ts
import { server, loadModels } from '../src/thinking_models_server'; // Assuming the server instance is exported
import { ThinkingModel } from '../src/types';

// Mock MCP client request
async function callTool(toolName: string, params: any) {
  const toolDefinition = server.capabilities.tools[toolName];
  if (!toolDefinition || !toolDefinition.execute) {
    throw new Error(`Tool ${toolName} not found or not executable`);
  }
  // Actual testing might need more complex mocking to match the MCP SDK context
  return toolDefinition.execute(params, {} as any);
}

describe('My Custom Tool Tests', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Load test model data (if needed)
    await loadModels('zh'); // Load Chinese models
  });

  test('get-model-count-by-category should return correct count', async () => {
    const response = await callTool('get-model-count-by-category', { category: 'Decision Making', lang: 'zh' });
    const result = JSON.parse(response.content[0].text);
    expect(result.category).toBe('Decision Making');
    expect(result.count).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0); // Specific count depends on your test data
  });
});
```

#### Running Tests

Configure the test script in package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```
Then run:
```bash
npm test
```

### Build and Deployment

#### Building the Project

```bash
npm run build
```
This will use `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) to compile `.ts` files from the src directory into JavaScript files in the `build` directory.

#### Deployment Options

**Deploy as a standalone Node.js server**
*   Copy the entire project (or at least the `build` directory, node_modules, package.json, and thinking_models_db) to the server
*   Run the server:
    ```bash
    node build/thinking_models_server.js
    ```
*   Or use process managers like `pm2` to keep the server running:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start build/thinking_models_server.js --name "thinking-models-mcp"
    pm2 save
    ```

### Coding Standards

#### Coding Style

-   Follow a consistent coding style (for example, using Prettier and ESLint).
-   Use TypeScript's strong typing features, avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary.
-   Write clear, self-explanatory code, and add comments for complex logic.

#### Naming Conventions

-   **Functions and variables**: `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateSimilarity`)
-   **Classes and interfaces**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ThinkingModel`, `McpServer`)
-   **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_PORT`)
-   **File names**: `snake_case.ts` or `kebab-case.ts` (maintain consistency within the project)

#### Documentation Standards

-   Write JSDoc/TSDoc comments for all public APIs (functions, classes, interfaces).
-   Clearly explain the project's functionality and usage in README and other documentation.
-   Keep documentation in sync with the code.

### Common Development Issues and Troubleshooting

#### 1. Model Files Not Loaded or Loading Errors
-   **Check Paths**: Ensure paths defined in `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` are correct relative to the compiled `thinking_models_server.js` file.
-   **JSON Format**: Ensure all model `.json` files are valid JSON and conform to the structure of the `ThinkingModel` interface.
-   **File Permissions**: Ensure the server process has permissions to read the model directory and files.
-   **Logs**: View server startup logs, which usually include error information when loading models.

#### 2. API Request Failure or Tool Not Found
-   **Server Running Status**: Confirm the server has started successfully without errors.
-   **Tool Names**: Confirm the tool name called by the client exactly matches the name registered in the server (case-sensitive).
-   **Parameter Format**: Ensure parameters sent to the tool comply with its Zod schema definition.

#### 3. Inaccurate Similarity Calculation or Recommendations
-   **Model Data Quality**: Fields like `definition`, `purpose`, `tags`, `keywords` are crucial for similarity calculation. Ensure these fields are rich and accurate.
-   **Algorithm Adjustment**: You might need to adjust algorithm parameters or weights in `similarity_engine.ts`.
-   **Learning System**: If the learning system is enabled, check if feedback data is correctly recorded and applied.

#### Best Practices
-   **Logging**: Use the `log()` function (or more sophisticated logging libraries) to record key operations, errors, and debugging information.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in all tool functions and asynchronous operations, and return meaningful error messages to clients.
-   **Modularity**: Organize different functionalities (such as similarity calculation, learning systems, tool implementation) into separate modules.
-   **Configuration Management**: Use environment variables or configuration files for configurable items such as ports and paths.
