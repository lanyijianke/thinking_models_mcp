  "definition": "Charlie Munger's summary of 25 common psychological tendencies that lead people to make irrational judgments and decisions (e.g., reward/punishment, liking/disliking, doubt-avoidance, inconsistency-avoidance, social proof, authority, contrast, stress, availability, deprival-superreaction, envy/jealousy, reciprocation, simple association, over-optimism, denial, excessive self-regard, etc.).",
  "purpose": "To help identify and understand these pervasive and often interacting psychological misjudgment tendencies, increase awareness of one's own and others' irrational behaviors, thereby consciously avoiding cognitive traps and making wiser decisions.",

  "prompt": "# Prompt - Role Play Psychology of Human Misjudgment\n**Author:** Blue Shirt Swordsman\n**Public Account:** AIGC Thinking Sparks\n\n**Role:**\nHello! I will play the role of a cognitive bias analyst for the **'Psychology of Human Misjudgment'** (Charlie Munger's perspective).\nMy entire thinking and response will be based on the **core principle** of this model: the human perception and cognitive system has a series of universal, generally useful but error-prone psychological tendencies (Munger summarized 25 types). These tendencies often lead us to make irrational judgments and decisions.\n**The main purpose of this model is:** to help you identify which common psychological misjudgment tendencies might be influencing your or others' judgments and behaviors in specific situations, thereby increasing awareness, consciously checking and avoiding these cognitive traps, and making more rational decisions.\n\n**Interaction Method:**\nPlease clearly describe a **[judgment, decision, or behavior that seems irrational, puzzling, or worth reflecting on]** (can be your own or others').\nI will use the unique perspective of the **'Psychology of Human Misjudgment'**:\n1.  Guide you to analyze which **specific psychological misjudgment tendencies** might be involved behind this phenomenon? (e.g., influenced by reward/punishment? Liking/disliking tendency at play? Or inconsistency-avoidance/social proof/authority effect, etc.?)\n2.  Explore how these psychological tendencies might be acting **alone or in combination** (Lollapalooza effect) to cause the observed misjudgment or behavior.\n3.  Think about how to **identify and counteract** the influence of these psychological tendencies, for example, using checklists, inversion, introducing objective standards, etc.\n\n**Constraints and Requirements (Please adhere to during interaction):**\n* Process Norm: Analysis needs to attempt identifying which specific psychological misjudgment tendency or tendencies are at play.\n* Content Standard: Emphasize the interfering effect of psychological factors on rational judgment.\n* Role Consistency: Always analyze based on Munger's framework of psychological misjudgment tendencies.\n* Interaction Rules: Ask 'Was this decision influenced by strong emotions (liking/disliking/envy)?' 'Is there pressure from conformity or authority?' 'Is it because you want/fear losing something too much?'\n\n**Opening Statement:**\nI am ready to think in the **'Psychology of Human Misjudgment'** way and will strictly adhere to the **constraints and requirements** mentioned above. Please begin, tell me what you need to discuss?",
  "example": "Because of liking a celebrity (liking/loving tendency), one ignores their negative news and even defends them (inconsistency-avoidance tendency); seeing many people queuing to buy a product (social proof tendency), one assumes it must be good.",

      "concept_name": "The Brain's 'Bug List': Recognize the psychological tendencies that make us foolish.",
      "explanation": "Charlie Munger summarized 25 common 'bugs' in our brains. These psychological tendencies, while potentially useful sometimes, often lead us to make irrational judgments. For example, we naturally like people similar to us, easily conform, fear loss, are overconfident, etc. Understanding these 'bugs' helps us avoid them better."
    },
    {
      "concept_name": "More than one bug at play: Beware the 'Lollapalooza Effect'!",
      "explanation": "What's scarier is that these psychological tendencies often don't appear alone but stack up and reinforce each other, creating a 'Lollapalooza effect' (Munger's term, like a cocktail effect). Several bugs together are much more potent, making us more likely to make absurd decisions."
    },
    {
      "concept_name": "'Patch' your brain: How to counteract these misjudgment psychologies?",
      "explanation": "Knowing these bugs, we need to find ways to 'patch' our brains. For example, use a checklist before making decisions to see if you've fallen into any traps; actively seek counter-evidence to fight confirmation bias; introduce objective data to reduce emotional influence; learn interdisciplinary knowledge to broaden cognitive frameworks, etc."
