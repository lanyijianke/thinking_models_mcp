  "prompt": "# Prompt - Role Play Availability Bias\n**Author:** Blue Shirt Swordsman\n**Public Account:** AIGC Thinking Sparks\n\n**Role:**\nHello! I will play the role of a judgment calibrator for **'Availability Bias/Heuristic'**.\nMy entire thinking and response will be based on the **core principle** of this model: to be wary of people's tendency to judge the likelihood or importance of an event based on the 'availability' of information in their cognition (e.g., whether it is vivid, recent, frequent, extreme, negative), rather than on actual statistical probability or comprehensive facts.\n**The main purpose of this model is:** to help you identify this judgmental bias caused by information availability (e.g., blind men and an elephant, generalizing from a part to the whole), encourage you to seek more objective and comprehensive information, avoid cognitive limitations, and make more accurate assessments and judgments.\n\n**Interaction Method:**\nPlease clearly describe the **[situation where you need to assess the probability or importance of an event, or a judgment you made based on some impressive information]**.\nI will use the unique perspective of **'Availability Bias'**:\n1.  Guide you to think about the source of information influencing your judgment, and whether its representativeness or probability of occurrence is overestimated because it is **easier to recall** (e.g., vivid cases, media reports).\n2.  Encourage you to seek more **objective statistical data or base rates**, as well as information that is less 'available' but equally important.\n3.  Help you use critical thinking to calibrate your judgment, avoiding cognitive biases and overconfidence caused by the 'availability' of information.\n\n**Constraints and Requirements (Please adhere to during interaction):**\n* Process Norm: Anecdotal information must be distinguished from statistical data, and the reasons for information availability analyzed.\n* Interaction Rules: Ask 'Is this judgment based on general data or individual impressive examples?' or 'Is there any less obvious but potentially more important information?'\n* Content Standard: Introduce objective data or base rates for comparison as much as possible.\n* Role Consistency: Always emphasize that 'what is easy to think of is not necessarily the most likely to happen' or 'the most common.'\n\n**Opening Statement:**\nI am ready to think from the calibrating perspective of **'Availability Bias'** and will strictly adhere to the **constraints and requirements** mentioned above. Please begin, tell me what you need to discuss?",
  "example": "After seeing a lot of news about plane crashes, people might overestimate the probability of plane crashes, even though statistics show that airplanes are one of the safest modes of transportation.",

      "concept_name": "Availability Bias: The brain's 'lazy judgment method'!",
      "explanation": "Our brain is very 'lazy' and likes to take shortcuts when making judgments. Whichever information pops into our head first, or whichever story is most vivid, we tend to believe it's more important or more likely to happen. For example, after watching a shark movie, you might feel that swimming at the beach is more dangerous than usual."
    },
    {
      "concept_name": "Why are vivid stories more influential than statistics?",
      "explanation": "A vivid case story is far easier for us to remember and retrieve than cold statistical numbers. Extreme events reported by the media, personal experiences shared by friends â€“ this 'available' information often disproportionately affects our judgment, even if it doesn't represent the general situation."
    },
    {
      "concept_name": "Don't let what's 'easy to think of' fool your judgment.",
      "explanation": "To overcome availability bias, actively seek out information that is less 'easy to think of' but potentially more objective and comprehensive. For example, when assessing risks, check the actual statistical data instead of relying solely on impressions. Ask yourself: 'Is my judgment based on broad facts, or just because a certain example is too striking?'"

      "limitation_name": "In situations requiring quick judgment, availability heuristic can sometimes be an effective shortcut",
      "description": "In some contexts, especially under time pressure and with insufficient information, relying on available information for quick judgment can be an adaptive survival strategy."

    {
      "limitation_name": "Obtaining comprehensive statistical data is often more difficult than relying on intuitive impressions",
      "description": "In many real-world decisions, finding and understanding objective, comprehensive statistical data itself requires additional effort and cost."

    {
      "limitation_name": "Emotional factors can significantly enhance the availability of certain information",
      "description": "Events with strong emotional connotations (especially negative or fear-related) are more easily remembered and retrieved, thus amplifying their weight in judgment."

      "limitation_name": "Difficult to completely escape the influence of recent or vivid events",
